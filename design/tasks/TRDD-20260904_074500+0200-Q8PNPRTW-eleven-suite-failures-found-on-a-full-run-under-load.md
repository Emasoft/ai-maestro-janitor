# Eleven suite failures, found by naming them — the prior run's file was truncated

## ⏵ STATE — READ THIS FIRST ON RESUME (authoritative; supersedes the body) — 2026-09-04

- **WHY THIS CARD EXISTS AT ALL.** The failures were found at 07:29 and lived only in
  `/tmp/soak8.txt` and one session's conversation, both of which die with the session. A
  finding that is not on the board has not been recorded — it has been *noticed*. This card
  is the record; the `/tmp` paths below are evidence, not storage.
- **A LEAN-WORKER IS TRIAGING THEM RIGHT NOW** (dispatched 07:44). It re-runs each file
  serially, classifies all 11 into real-product-defect / real-test-defect / load-artifact /
  environment, fixes the first two buckets, and writes
  `reports/suite-failures/<ts>-11-failure-triage.md`. It is explicitly forbidden from
  committing, from widening a timeout to "fix" a load artifact, and from touching
  `branch_protection_apply.py` / its test file.
- **NEXT ACTION** — read that report, verify its classification FIRST-HAND for anything it
  calls a real defect (grep the line it cites; do not take a subagent's word for a defect),
  then commit its fixes and re-run the full suite.
- **This is a publish gate.** The standing USER directive is *"bump and publish a new
  version, but only after you completed all TRDDs and fixed all issues."* Eleven red tests
  are issues. Nothing publishes until this card is terminal or every remaining failure is
  proven to be a load artifact of the shared 36-user host.

## The failures

From `uv run pytest tests/ -q -n auto --dist loadgroup --timeout=300`, started 07:14 at
load 11.39, finished 07:29: **11 failed, 16380 passed, 1 skipped, 8 subtests passed** in
906.91 s. Raw: `/tmp/soak8.txt`, `/tmp/soak8.meta` (load before/after).

## How they were found, and why the previous session could not name them

The prior session's run (`/tmp/soak7.txt`, 07:02) was **killed mid-flight** by a
`/clear` + reload: the file stops at ~99 % with no summary and therefore no `FAILED` lines.
Its handoff recorded "ONE unnamed `F` at 64 %", which was a reading of the progress dots —
`/tmp/soak7.txt` in fact carries `F` marks at 14 %, 18 %, 19 % (six on one line), 62 %, 65 %
and at the truncation point.

**The lesson is already a known one and it recurred anyway:** a `F` in the progress dots is
not an identification, and `FAILED` summary lines print only at the end. A truncated pytest
capture cannot be counted, only re-run.

## Serial isolation — COMPLETE and labelled (`/tmp/isolate11.txt`, finished 07:41)

`7 failed, 5 passed in 588.29s` running exactly these tests serially, `-p no:randomly`, no
`-n`. (12 ran, not 11: `TestMemoryLibrarianReindex` expands to 4.)

**Reproduce WITHOUT parallelism — not load artifacts:**

```
tests/test_capture_all_logins.py::test_kill_process_group_terminates_a_grandchild_too
tests/test_capture_all_logins.py::test_capture_one_kills_the_whole_tree_and_reports_timeout
tests/test_marketplace_refresh_scoped.py::test_per_session_refreshes_each_unique_marketplace
tests/test_memory_librarian.py::TestMemoryLibrarianReindex::test_reindex_invoked_for_the_local_root
tests/test_memory_librarian.py::TestMemoryLibrarianReindex::test_reindex_runs_before_index_query
tests/test_memory_librarian.py::TestMemoryLibrarianReindex::test_reindex_failure_is_tolerated
tests/test_token_usage_anomaly_detector.py::test_alarm_enriched_with_agentlens
```

**Pass serially, fail under `-n auto` — candidate load/parallelism artifacts, cause still
unnamed:** the three `test_gh_reply_watch.py` tests and
`test_marketplace_refresh_scoped.py::test_disabled_plugins_are_skipped`. "Passes serially"
is a symptom; the acceptance criteria below require the CAUSE before any of these four is
accepted as an artifact.

> **PROVENANCE CORRECTION.** The first version of this section, and commit `81c9373b`'s
> body, asserted "several already reproduce serially" from an *unlabelled progress-dot
> string* (`FF.F....FFF`) whose mapping to test ids was an inference from argument order.
> The card said so explicitly and the commit message then leaned on it anyway. The claim has
> since turned out TRUE — but it was stated before it was established, which is the same
> defect (`ATOM-I13I-A52N`, "reading a check as establishing more than it did") this session
> has now hit twice. The dot string is not evidence; this labelled run is.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every one of the 11 is classified into exactly one bucket — product defect / test
      defect / load-parallelism artifact / environment — each with the quoted assertion or
      traceback line that justifies it. No bucket assigned by elimination.
- [ ] Every product defect and test defect is FIXED, and the fix verified by running that
      file serially to green.
- [ ] Any test classified as a load artifact says WHY in the card (tight timeout, shared tmp
      path, global state, port) — "passes serially" alone is a symptom, not a cause, and a
      test that fails under the suite's own default invocation is still a broken test.
- [ ] No failure is "fixed" by widening a timeout unless the timeout is shown to be the
      actual cause and the new value is justified in one sentence.
- [ ] `uv run ruff check scripts tests`, `uv run mypy scripts/ --ignore-missing-imports`
      and `uvx --with pyright pyright` all clean. **All three** — a clean run of any two
      proves nothing here.
- [ ] A full `-n auto` suite run comes back green, or every remaining red is a documented,
      accepted load artifact with its cause named.

## Notes

- `TRDD-7NSRD8OV` is the card about saturating this shared 36-user box. These failures are
  data adjacent to it, but this card is NOT that experiment and must not be spent as
  evidence for it: this run was not pre-registered, and load 11.39 sits inside the range
  that card's existing runs already cover.
