# Verified actuation blocks the single-threaded daemon beat

## ⏵ STATE — READ THIS FIRST ON RESUME (authoritative; supersedes the body) — 2026-09-03

- **NOT STARTED.** Nothing is broken today that anyone has observed; this card exists because a
  cost was introduced knowingly and its size was never measured.
- **NEXT ACTION** — the measurement below, step 1. It is a read of data already on disk. **Do
  not choose a mechanism before it.**
- **SUPERSEDED — do NOT carry forward** — none.

## What changed and why it costs

TRDD-N954KWUC P3 made every janitor keystroke go through read → decide → type → **verify by
re-reading**. The verification is the point of the card: typing blind is what produced the
2026-09-02 incident.

But the pre-P3 baseline was genuinely free. `fleet_inject.fire` spawns the four keystroke
channels (iterm / tmux / wtype / xdotool) with `subprocess.Popen(..., start_new_session=True)`
and never waits — its own docstring says the detachment exists "so the daemon never blocks and
is never killed by the very ESC the plan sends". Only the `aimaestro` channel is synchronous,
and it is an RPC with a meaningful exit code.

So P3 did not make *typing* block. It added **reads** to a loop that previously had none:

- `pane_policy.execute` re-reads after every press, and once more while it waits for the last
  press to take.
- `pane_actuate._read` does `time.sleep(_SETTLE_S)` (3.0 s) before each read so a real terminal
  can repaint.
- The loop runs `max(retries, step.repeat_max)` times.

For the rotation flush (`repeat_max = 1 + queued`, `retries = 3`) that is **up to ~9 s per
wedged pane**, synchronously, on the daemon's single-threaded beat. The recovery rung
(`daemon.py` session-liveness ladder) and fleet-stop pay the same shape.

## Why this is not obviously urgent, and not obviously fine

The failure mode, if it exists, is starvation: a weekly wall wedges *every* pane at once, so
the cost is `panes × ~9 s` in one beat, during which nothing else on the beat runs — including
`task_oauth_rotator_tick`, whose interval is `_INTERVAL_OAUTH_TICK = 60`. That is the task that
rotates *out* of the wall. A guardian that starves its own recovery during the exact event it
exists for would be a serious bug.

**But the multiplier is unmeasured.** On a 1-2 pane fleet, 9 s is invisible and this card is
noise. On a 20-pane fleet it is a real stall. Nobody has counted the panes.

Two reviewers rated this finding on the strength of a baseline claim ("`fire` was detached")
that neither had read at the time. The claim turned out to be TRUE — but it was still an
unread claim, and the *severity* rests on a second number nobody has looked up at all. Picking
a mechanism before knowing which failure it must prevent is the wrong order, and it is how a
plugin option nobody needs gets shipped.

## Plan

1. **MEASURE FIRST — no experiment required, the data is already on disk.** Read the
   beat-to-beat wall-clock deltas in
   `~/.claude/plugins/data/ai-maestro-janitor-ai-maestro-plugins/global-state/daemon.log`
   across a rotation window (a window where `rotation-esc:` lines appear), and compare them to
   the beat interval and to `_INTERVAL_OAUTH_TICK`. Also count the instances a real
   `gather_fleet` returns on this host. If beats stay on cadence, this card is a comment and a
   close; if they stretch toward 60 s, it is urgent.
2. **Only then choose.** Options, cheapest first — the right one depends entirely on step 1:
   - **Spend fewer reads.** The loop keeps re-reading after the press budget is exhausted; the
     final iteration types nothing and still sleeps. Bounding that is a small change inside
     `execute` and is behaviour-preserving for every step whose `repeat_max` is 1. It costs
     patience for the decisive press, which is a real trade, not a free win.
   - **Make `settle_s` a plugin option.** Smallest surface, but it moves the decision to the
     user rather than removing the risk.
   - **Move actuation off the beat.** Correct in the large, biggest change, and only justified
     if step 1 shows real starvation.
   - **A wall-clock cap per beat is a trap**: it makes a pane's press count depend on how many
     panes preceded it, so pane 9 behaves differently from pane 1 for reasons invisible in its
     own log line. Do not take this one without a strong reason.

## Acceptance

- [ ] The measurement from step 1 is recorded here as a number, with the log window it came
      from — beats/minute during a rotation window vs. outside one, and the fleet size.
- [ ] A decision is recorded: either "no action, cost is invisible at this fleet size" (and this
      card closes) or a named mechanism with the measurement that justifies it.
- [ ] If a mechanism lands: a test pins the bound, and `oauth-rotator-tick` is shown still
      running on cadence with every pane wedged.
